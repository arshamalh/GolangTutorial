1
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,279
The core compression algorithm is optimal.

2
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,690
All the test cases ran optimal.

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,520
The Weissman score is optimal.

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,940
Looks like Nucleus is optimal.

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,330
Good. Good.

6
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:23,200
Congratulations, guys.

7
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:32,880
- Oh yeah.
- Oh, dog.

8
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:38,520
Richard, the ingestion engine is ready
for testing. Have you seen Richard?

9
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,640
He's in there, having a little trouble
with his personal ingestion engine.

10
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:44,860
Still? It's been an hour.
He's gotta get this done.

11
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:48,640
Oh, he's got his laptop in
there, on top of his lap.

12
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:50,900
Hey, Richard.

13
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,650
Don't talk to me while
I'm in the bathroom please.

14
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,489
Well, snap it off, we gotta go.

15
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:57,490
I know. Just don't talk
to me while I'm in here. It's weird.

16
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,950
Oh, my God. Jared's been
back from that island

17
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,320
for a whole day and he
didn't get any toilet paper?

18
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:04,490
Are you serious? Is Jared out there?

19
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,630
I thought you didn't want me to talk to you

20
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,660
while you were in the
bathroom. Make up your mind.

21
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,630
You know what? Just
get away from the door, please.

22
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,470
Friday, the pool cleaner comes.

23
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,300
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

24
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,220
And tomorrow is trash day so make
sure all the cans are out front.

25
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:18,920
Yes.

26
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:22,840
Now, you are under no circumstances
to order any movie on demand,

27
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,100
adult or otherwise.

28
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,680
Yes.

29
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:27,670
OK, has anything that I've
just said confused you?

30
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,029
- Yes.
- Goddamn it!

31
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,650
Jesus, Cher. Are you
bringing your whole closet?

32
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:37,240
I'm a pro, Dinesh. I
won't apologize for it.

33
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,990
I dress according to the moods
that I sense in the room.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,460
As such, I must have options.

35
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,539
We all packed and ready to go?

36
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:49,040
We can take my car
but gas is on the company.

37
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:51,370
Hello? Did everyone leave?

38
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,380
No.

39
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:54,760
What? Oh. Whoa, whoa...

40
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:06,300

41
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,616
I don't know how you
read your screen in the car.

42
00:02:08,617 --> 00:02:09,819
It makes me sick as a dog.

43
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,860
I'm OK as long
as I don't think about it.

44
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,560
Besides, the presentation is tomorrow.

45
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,530
So if you just don't think
about it it really doesn't bother you

46
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,400
to be staring at the screen
when the car's moving

47
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,259
and turning and you're all queasy...

48
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,229
Oh, God!

49
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:24,979
- Gilfoyle.
- See, I knew it bothered you.

50
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,050
Fucking liar.

51
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,670
So I'm a little behind, being
stuck on that island for four days,

52
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,110
but I think I'm on top of everything.

53
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,769
OK, give me your IDs and
I'll go register us...

54
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:47,340
There you are. Got your
credentials and wristbands

55
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,750
for the walkthrough at 4:00 today.

56
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,020
Uh, walkthrough?

57
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,180
Yeah, basically, it's a sound
check for the competition.

58
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,320
Uh, yeah, we didn't know about that.

59
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:58,190
Did I not tell you about the walkthrough?

60
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,270
I am so sorry.

61
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,119
That's why I'm here. Peter's on safari

62
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,119
with Lorne Michaels and
Kanye West until next week

63
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,450
so I can put all of my
attention on you guys for once.

64
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:10,810
I am so sorry. I thought that I
talked to you guys about the walk...

65
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,430
Gentlemen, welcome to the big show.

66
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,480
TechCrunch motherfucking Disrupt.

67
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,979
OK, guys, this place is
a vortex of distraction

68
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,470
Normally in the tech world
it's two percent women.

69
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,730
Guys, these next three days, 15 percent.

70
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,989
It's a goddamn meat market.

71
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,480
I need you to focus.

72
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:42,530
How we do here is the entire
future of your company.

73
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,950
Don't screw it all up now.

74
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,150
We have to knock them dead
in the preliminaries tomorrow

75
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,999
so we can move on to the finals on Friday.

76
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,540
I have a question. The program says
that Dan Melcher is judging our round.

77
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,830
Is there any way to get him removed?

78
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,630
Not unless there's a conflict of interest.

79
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:02,849
Well, there may be. I did have
sexual intercourse with his wife.

80
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,010
What? It was three years ago.

81
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,470
So one of the guys judging
us wants to fucking kill you?

82
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,640
Maybe. I don't know if he found out.

83
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,850
Either way, Richard, you may have to
present instead of me so be prepared.

84
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,320
What, me? Present? No.

85
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:18,240
We may be fine. We may be totally fine.

86
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,570
We also may be totally fucked.

87
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,860
I'll let you know either way.

88
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,190
I'm gonna go network. Don't approach me.

89
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,410
I don't want to present.

90
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,580
Besides, I'm not even done with the demo.

91
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:32,709
OK, Richard, you need to go to
the hotel right now and finish.

92
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:35,879
- Oh, you already checked us into the hotel?
- Yeah. Yeah.

93
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,500
OK, I'm gonna
do this module by module.

94
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:41,960
Dinesh, you built the edge video player
so I'm gonna start with you first. OK?

95
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:44,630
OK, you guys set up the booth, OK?

96
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,700
Um... I think it's this way.

97
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:51,720
You think?

98
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,800
A few flyers, that's all we have?

99
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,060
Yeah, I think it is.

100
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,060
Hello, what's your name?

101
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,640
Visit us at microdrone.com...

102
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:05,480
Oh, wow, Microdrone. They just
closed $17 million in seed funding.

103
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,870
Hi. Hello. Excuse me.

104
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,910
Pied Piper? You guys are competing
in the StartUp Battlefield, right?

105
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,630
Everyone has been talking
about your compression rate.

106
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,210
I mean, it is supposed to be sick.

107
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,910
Yeah.

108
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,630
Anyway, you must be great with Java

109
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:25,340
and I just cannot seem to figure
out this stupid bug. Do you mind?

110
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,470
I'll be back.

111
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,170
Thank you.

112
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,840
If we integrate one module every two
hours we should be in great shape...

113
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:35,769
Richard, follow me. Follow me. Follow me.

114
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:39,270
- All right. See you at the hotel.
- See you.

115
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,990
Very soon, I hope.

116
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,910
Hey, man. Just wanted to say good luck.

117
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,830
OK, thanks. But what's with all the...

118
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,410
Sorry. I just can't be seen
talking to you, you know?

119
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,280
Hooli people all over the place.

120
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:57,330
I don't know, man, I'm just really into
this whole rest and vest life, you know,

121
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,290
way more than I thought I would be.

122
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,299
I just don't want to rock the boat.

123
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,630
Oh, hey, did I tell
you? I'm getting a boat.

124
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,010
- Wow.
- And a boat guy to take care of it.

125
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,680
You have to have a boat guy.

126
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:10,300
- Oh yeah, you've gotta have a boat guy...
- if you have a boat.

127
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:13,930
Hey, um, you know that girl, right?

128
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,470
Sherry, I think her name was. She
said you guys went to school together.

129
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,720
Uh, OK, yeah.

130
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:20,810
I saw her at the Valleywag
party last night,

131
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:24,810
which was crazy, by the way, dude,
there must've been like 12 girls there.

132
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,450
- Holy shit.
- Nuts.

133
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,480
Anyway, she said you guys
went out a couple times

134
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:33,400
and then she dumped you and
you became obsessed with her.

135
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:36,960
What? What? She said I was obsessed?

136
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:39,160
She said obsessed.

137
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:41,660
Uh, that's bullshit, 'cause I
think we went out two times.

138
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:44,630
Uh, it was nothing so how
could I be obsessed? That's...

139
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,750
No, you're going down! Nucleus
is gonna crush Wide Diaper.

140
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:53,920
You never shoulda said no
to my man, Gavin Belson.

141
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,210
OK.

142
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,180
Seeded quite a few new companies.

143
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,770
Spinder. It's like
Tinder but for spinsters.

144
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,982
Elderly women looking for sex.

145
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,850
There's this girl who's walking around,
saying that I'm obsessed with her.

146
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,559
Now that just really pisses me off

147
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,832
That's fascinating. Let's
just forget about it, OK?

148
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:37,937
Yeah.

149
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:43,060
I mean it's... It's just
so fucked up, right?

150
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,780
I mean, I barely remember her.

151
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:47,640
And it's just so insulting to have someone
walking around spreading lies about you.

152
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:51,239
Right? I wonder who she's working with.

153
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,490
Like I wonder who she's here with
because if she's telling her coworkers,

154
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,200
then that's a whole 'nother group
of people I gotta worry about.

155
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,870
Richard, you don't have
to worry about anything

156
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,910
- except for Pied Pier right now.
- Yeah, I know.

157
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,810
Because we have less than 24
hours 'til the preliminaries.

158
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,359
No one's worrying, that's the thing.

159
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,360
- Perfect.
- Perfect.

160
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:11,970
OK, her.

161
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,390
She used the word "obsessed", Dinesh.

162
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,340
- "Obsessed."
- Richard, I don't care.

163
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:24,400
Neither do I. That's the entire point.

164
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,430
I'm just gonna check her
Instagram real quick.

165
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,320
Because if she's posting comments
about me being obsessed...

166
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:34,240
I mean, I can't just ignore that.

167
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,110
Would you be interested in a device
that links to your smartphone

168
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,000
and lets you know, even before it happens,
whether you're having a panic attack

169
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,670
- or a heart attack?
- Yeah, yeah.

170
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,330
OK, here's how Panic-A-Tech works.

171
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,870
You wear this on your finger all
day and it tracks your vitals.

172
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,040
Or if that's too embarrassing,
there's also a Bluetooth suppository

173
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,430
and that goes right
where you think it goes.

174
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,290
And that comes with a retrieval kit.

175
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:57,100
Was he like, "Bro, you're my bro,"

176
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,344
or was he like, "I wanna
shoot you in the face

177
00:08:59,345 --> 00:09:01,149
and watch you bleed out all over the stage

178
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,520
'cause you fucked my wife, you cocksuck."

179
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:07,520
Right in the middle. It was like:

180
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,290
Huh.

181
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,060
What happened? How's it going at the hotel?

182
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:15,159
Weird. He switched to meta-data
extraction and now wants to see you.

183
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,150
Meta-data? Already? Makes no sense.

184
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,669
He seems very distracted.

185
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:26,839
OK, guys, since we're kind
of playing from behind here

186
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,300
I put together a little secret weapon.

187
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:33,300
I... I went through the entire
list of conference participants

188
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:36,200
and I found images and I found
bios and I printed them out

189
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,300
so we have them all in one place.

190
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,240
- Why did you do that?
- Uh, OK.

191
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:44,510
Who's this guy? Watch. He is...

192
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,150
Rick Smith, co-founder of Crosscut Ventures.

193
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,029
How did you...?

194
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:53,240
ID-Keen. It's this facial recognition
app that Monica put on our phones.

195
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,160
You just point it at anybody,
tells you who they are

196
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,910
and how important they
are to the conference.

197
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,539
You're not showing up at all.

198
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:07,200
Yeah, maybe I'm not getting
a... No, I'm getting a signal.

199
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:11,120
OK. Um, well...

200
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:14,260
Ooh, Jared, Jared, recycling's over there.

201
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:17,260
Hey, so what's the deal?
Does the judge know or not?

202
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:20,050
I don't know, Monica. He's toying with me.

203
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:23,300
Or maybe he's not. I can't
fucking figure it out.

204
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:25,890
Erlich, you need to stop
this. His wife is here.

205
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,220
Grow a pair and talk to
her, find out for sure.

206
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:31,069
Why don't you grow a pair
and I'll talk to her.

207
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,730
Hmph.

208
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,230
What?

209
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:40,980
Hey.

210
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,409
Do you happen to know Java?

211
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:45,290
Are you kidding? It's like my specialty.

212
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,490
Will you help me?

213
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,662
Oh, it would be my honor.

214
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,350
Yes?

215
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,400
Oh, sorry. Um, I must
not have the right room.

216
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:16,320
I'm looking for Dan Melcher.

217
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:17,279
Yeah, that's us.

218
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,910
Oh, it is? OK.

219
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,940
I was looking to speak with his wife.

220
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:25,700
That's me. I'm, well, his new
wife, we just got married.

221
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,830
Oh, congratulations.

222
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,280
Uh, what happened with Madelyn?

223
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:33,540
- You're a friend of Dan's?
- Yeah.

224
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:35,840
We've... We have a common interest...s.

225
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:38,210
- Uh, many common interests.
- Yeah.

226
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,460
Well, she was a nightmare.

227
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,830
Pills, in and out of rehab.

228
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,770
Had all of these disgusting affairs.

229
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,479
You know, the divorce nearly killed Dan.

230
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,560
Really? Disgusting affairs.

231
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,319
Well, I... I feel terrible.

232
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,310
No, it's fine. He's put it behind him.

233
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,150
All of it? I mean, every aspect of it?

234
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,780
Mm-hmm.

235
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:03,850
Well, that is... That is great to hear.

236
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,990
What if she's spreading this lie
to everyone at this conference?

237
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,370
I mean, honestly, Gilfoyle...

238
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:12,830
Richard, stop talking about this
or I have to punch you in the face.

239
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:17,410
Fuck. It is huge.

240
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,470
- Uh...
- Very, very huge.

241
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,300
Check, one-two two,

242
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,510
tsetse fly, tsetse fly.

243
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,140
Hey, how's the demo coming?

244
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:30,090
Um, we're getting there. Uh,
definitely... Getting there.

245
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,850
Gentlemen, I bring good tidings.

246
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:37,100
Turns out that Melcher
is divorced, remarried

247
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:40,690
and has put the previously
relationship behind him completely.

248
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,660
Problem solved.

249
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,870
That's great.

250
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,369
It sure is, Richard, it sure as hell is.

251
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:49,830
Look at these poor fuckers.

252
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,030
They don't even know
what's about to hit 'em.

253
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,370
The hammer of God.

254
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,920
I am so sorry! I am so sorry. I
thought you guys were gonna come get me

255
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,840
and... and I'm sorry.

256
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,210
Wait, Jared, what are you doing here?

257
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,210
What?

258
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,510
- Who's watching the booth?
- Yeah.

259
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,219
I thought that maybe Monica could...

260
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:08,470
She's not in the company. We
need her here. That's the thing.

261
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,380
All right, everybody, this run-through
is for essential personnel only,

262
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:15,060
essential only.

263
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,610
Oh.

264
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,940
- We need someone in the booth is the thing.
- Right.

265
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,530
You're essential to the booth.

266
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,780
Right.

267
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:25,820
All right, each team will have six
minutes for presentation and demo,

268
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,620
at which point the judges
will ask a few questions...

269
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,740
Uh, do you mind if I break
in here, just one question.

270
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,460
Uh, are the judges
allowed to send us through

271
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,910
to the finals immediately after we present

272
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:40,210
or do we have to wait until
everyone else has gone?

273
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:46,340
Well, I'm just saying
what everybody's thinking.

274
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:50,916
Hello, what's
your name? Visit us at microdrone.com

275
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:53,500
- Uh, excuse me, no thank you.
- ...a free video of you

276
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:55,670
- at TechCrunch Disrupt.
- Uh, no thank you.

277
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,420
Nathan. Are you Nathan
Zimmerman, CEO of Flingual?

278
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:02,960
I... I... Whoever's
doing this, no thank you.

279
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:05,469
Yeah, I think we got a dead zone,
an audio dead zone right here.

280
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,850
Listen to this.

281
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,510
Hear that? Compared to...

282
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,549
OK, here's what I want, as
soon as the music comes up...

283
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,196
- Music?
- I want you to hit me with a spotlight, bam!

284
00:14:14,197 --> 00:14:15,640
And a hard spot.

285
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,832
Better yet, do you have
those spotlights that...

286
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,789
come up from the ground,

287
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:22,310
- like in Pride Fighting.
- Uh... I can check.

288
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,650
OK, so two of those, one on each
side and then one in the center

289
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,659
so that it casts my shadow behind me, like
a giant looking over his own shoulder.

290
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,524
- - Do
you have any wind machines.

291
00:14:31,525 --> 00:14:33,200
I'm gonna need two of those...

292
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,660
Are you humming to yourself?

293
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:37,630
Was... was I?

294
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,240
Uh, you know, honestly,

295
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,800
I may have found the perfect woman.

296
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:45,220
Whoa. What? Who? Who?

297
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,880
She's in the booth right
next to us, Charlotte.

298
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:49,000
She's not even physically
my type, she has blonde hair

299
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:52,849
and these stupid pink streaks and
doesn't seem to be dominant at all.

300
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,510
However, I think I'm in love.

301
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,240
Whoa.

302
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,820
She invited me to her room to
watch Cloud Atlas later tonight.

303
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:03,150
Oh yeah, that means she
wants you to lay her.

304
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,100
Is that definitive?

305
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:07,240
I mean, nobody can watch more
than like a minute of that film.

306
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,320
So what's the deal? I mean, is she hot?

307
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:11,080
Yeah, I mean, she's attractive,

308
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:15,000
but almost every woman is
attractive. It was her mind.

309
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:19,350
She wrote this Java method that was the most
beautiful thing I've ever seen in my life.

310
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,600
Elegant, tight.

311
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:24,879
There's just something so hot about
a woman that can code like that.

312
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,340
You know, I just want to...

313
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:30,010
crawl in her frontal lobe and...

314
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,719
What's up?

315
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,020
You know I wrote that code, right?

316
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:36,380
No, this code was on her system.

317
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:40,390
A banged up 15-inch MacBook
Pro with shitty stickers on it?

318
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,690
Everyone here has a beat
up 15-inch MacBook Pro...

319
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,610
With a 1.3 chip and only two gigs of RAM?

320
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:50,070
She doesn't know Java. I wrote that code.

321
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,570
- You said you were in love with her mind.
- Oh fuck.

322
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:55,079
- You realize what's going on, right?
- Uh...

323
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,240
It's not her you're sexually
attracted to, it's my code.

324
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,910
Shut the... That is the most
disgusting fucking thing I've ever h...

325
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,410
Just face it, Dinesh, you're gay
for my code, you're code gay.

326
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:08,750
No! No, I'm into her.
Her, OK? Fuck your code!

327
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,759
You'd like to fuck my code, wouldn't you?

328
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,390
Hey, would you like to masturbate
to the subroutine I just wrote?

329
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,760
No! It's... I'm... I'm...

330
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:18,210
And then I'll sort of close
right here in the center

331
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,510
with a confidence and poise that, well,

332
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,600
they probably won't have
seen up until this point.

333
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:27,600
And then at that point we've got some photos
that we're gonna throw up on the big screen.

334
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:28,600
Photos?

335
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,320
Yeah, you know, just a few.

336
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,770
Gandhi, MLK, me as an inquisitive child.

337
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,440
Richard, could you please.

338
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:38,619
Oh, yes, sorry. I'll just plug it in here.

339
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,610
No! Don't!

340
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,420
- Don't!
- Oh, shi...

341
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,540
- What the fuck!?
- Shit.

342
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:47,790
- Oh, she's here.
- Mmm.

343
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,290
Oh, shit, it's frozen. It's frozen.

344
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,390
That is not me, obviously.

345
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:57,690
He's obsessed with me. I'm sorry.

346
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,610
Hey, what's wrong?

347
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:15,230
I'm just a little nervous
'cause you're so beautiful.

348
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,380
Oh?

349
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:18,570
Random question...

350
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,910
So you didn't write any of that Java code?

351
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,790
Uh-uh.

352
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,839
But I write all of our tweets and we
have like a couple hundred followers.

353
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:30,380
Couple hundred...

354
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:40,810
Oh, let me move this.

355
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,560
Oh, that's the code your friend wrote.

356
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:43,810
- Yeah, it is.
- It's really good, huh?

357
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:50,990
It's fine. I don't care about it.

358
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,320
Mm, there we go.

359
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:58,030
Oh, fu...

360
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:13,380
Come on, focus, focus.

361
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,350
Richard's not gonna finish, is he?

362
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:26,450
He'll finish, Gilfoyle, he has to.

363
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,890
Are you OK?

364
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,469
Yeah, I'm fine.

365
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:34,539
I knew it. You couldn't do it.

366
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:38,230
Please shut up. Shut up.

367
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,320
Why is it that every time I'm
about to have sex with a lady...

368
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,870
he's all up in there somehow?

369
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,580
Finally, just us. Guys,
this round is on me.

370
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:51,500
Hey, Jared. There you guys go.

371
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:54,130
- To Pied Piper. Hmm?
- To Pied Piper.

372
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,470
Here, here.

373
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,720
Yeah, drink it up.

374
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:02,060
But it's not gonna change who you are.

375
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:04,980
Monica, can I speak to you for a minute?

376
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,510
Yeah.

377
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,150
No, Sherry, it has to be now!

378
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,430
Oh, shit.

379
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,350
OK, look, we need to talk.

380
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,270
You keep telling people
I'm obsessed with you.

381
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,860
- Richard, why don't you just take a step back...
- It's not true...

382
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,020
No, no, no, let me finish.

383
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,660
OK, did I put your picture

384
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:21,580
up on the big screen
in the auditorium? Yes.

385
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,610
But that's because I was
showing you to my friends

386
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,700
to prove a point that I'm
not obsessed with you.

387
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:30,370
- Richard, I'm gonna go now.
- No, I'm not obsessed with you, Sherry!

388
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:33,460
I'm...

389
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:34,790
I'm not.

390
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,679
That guy Richard I was telling you about

391
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,439
just totally freaked out on me.

392
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,930
Yeah, the obsessed guy.

393
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,350
- Where are you?
- You've been doing this ever since

394
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,050
- we arrived at the conference.
- Which elevators?

395
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:47,979
You really think that you can come
between me and Richard Hendricks?

396
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:51,479
We're partners, OK, and
I've devoted every second

397
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,810
of my waking life for the
past two months to him, OK?

398
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:58,860
I am devoted to him and to the precious
thing that we're building together!

399
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:02,030
I'm his partner. I can
tell when he's vomiting...

400
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,200
- What? No.
- because he's nervous or when he's vomiting

401
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:05,650
- Never mind, Kate, I'm fine.
- ...because he's sick

402
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:08,040
or when he's vomiting because
he had cilantro, which he loves

403
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:10,160
but he shouldn't have
because it makes him...

404
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:14,750
I had no idea that you felt this
way. I mean it, I am so sorry.

405
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,670
I mean, I'm obsessed with her...

406
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:23,009
Richard, can I talk to you for a second?

407
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:28,890
Uh, OK.

408
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,760
I owe you an apology. I was way off base.

409
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:34,260
Well, yeah, you were.

410
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:36,100
He cleared it all up for me.

411
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:39,020
- Jared? Really?
- Yeah. He's your partner, right?

412
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:42,190
Yeah, he is. One of many.

413
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,530
Probably too many.

414
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,230
How could I not have seen this?

415
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,450
Obviously you're not obsessed with me.

416
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:53,250
Richard, it's none of my
business, but be safe.

417
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:58,420
- OK?
- OK.

418
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:02,290
Of course I'm safe. I backup my
whole system like five times a day.

419
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,880
So... uh, Jared, hey,

420
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,930
thank you.

421
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,430
For what?

422
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,180
Uh, you know, everything.

423
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:13,100
I feel like we don't appreciate you enough,

424
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:16,220
so thank you.

425
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,560
Are you... are you crying?

426
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,060
Are you crying?

427
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:25,550
Uh, don't do that. Don't cry.

428
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,070
Oh, shit. I gotta get back to work.

429
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,620
I... I need to focus here.

430
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:33,870
We should all go.

431
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,790
All right, I'm taking care of this one.

432
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,910
But when we win this fuckin' thing,
Richard, you're buying the next round.

433
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,630
Yeah.

434
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,920
Oh... no.

435
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:48,260
We're with the conference, is
there any sort of discount...?

436
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:50,310
- Kind of break you can...?
- Hm-mm.

437
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,390
No. All right.

438
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,930
- Hello again.
- Oh, hi.

439
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:58,939
You know, that was really sweet of
you to be so concerned about Dan.

440
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,600
He really has been through hell.

441
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:04,400
Well, it's the least I could do.

442
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:06,240
So how did you know Madelyn again?

443
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:09,490
Oh, uh, long story.

444
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,110
Yeah?

445
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:17,370
I have to admit, I'm curious.

446
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:21,290
You know what, keep it open.

447
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:25,380
Have you ever cared too much?

448
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,970
People, are you ready?

449
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:37,140
Are you ready for the ultimate
tech startup competition?

450
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:38,710
Let me hear it:

451
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,980
Disrupt!

452
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:45,310
Disrupt.

453
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:48,820
Hello. My name is Saeed Jobrani.

454
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,950
I am the CEO of ImmediBug.

455
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,150
And we're here to revolutionize

456
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,660
the way you report bugs
on your mobile platform.

457
00:22:56,670 --> 00:23:01,510
Happin! will revolutionize location-based
mobile news aggregation as you know it.

458
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,220
We're making the world a better
place, through paxos algorithms

459
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,670
for consensus protocols.

460
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,509
And we're making the world a better place

461
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:11,640
through software defined data
centers for cloud computing.

462
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:16,010
A better place through canonical data
models to communicate between endpoints.

463
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,180
A better place through scalable,

464
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:21,359
fault-tolerant distributed
databases with asset transactions.

465
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,100
And we are truly local mobile social.

466
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:26,820
And we're completely So-Mo-Lo.

467
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,190
And we're Mo-Lo-So.

468
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,770
We're Lo-Mo-So, bro.

469
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:33,780
We were So-Lo-Mo but now we're Mo-Lo-So.

470
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:39,330
No, Mo-So-Lo. No...

471
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,780
You want me to get a water or something?

472
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:44,379
- Yeah, drink this.
- Here.

473
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,379
- So we're all good?
- We're all great.

474
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:49,460
I killed it. Our Weissman
score on all tests: 2.89.

475
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,260
Right at the theoretical limit.

476
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:53,350
Yeah, all the edge modules are humming.

477
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,220
Uh, even on mobile. They
can throw anything at us.

478
00:23:56,230 --> 00:24:00,890
Great. Well, good luck.
I'm gonna go find my seat.

479
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,770
Um, except 3D video.

480
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,860
What?

481
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:06,640
3D video's still a little hinky.

482
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:09,409
Erlich better steer them away
from that just to be safe.

483
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:12,400
Where the hell is Erlich?

484
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:14,200
He wasn't with you guys this morning?

485
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:16,750
Rather than heating an entire room,

486
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,460
HumanHeater is a microwave technology

487
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:22,589
that can heat the surface
of a person's skin instead,

488
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:25,300
potentially saving
millions in heating costs

489
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,530
and helping the environment,

490
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:30,670
thereby making the world a better place.

491
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,220
Judges.

492
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:36,640
Uh... OK, so,

493
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:39,140
you want to heat people

494
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:41,760
with microwaves, is that right?

495
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,770
That can't be safe.

496
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:47,480
That's a great question and
trust me, it is very, very safe.

497
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:50,190
I've been working on it for 15 years.

498
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,070
I don't trust you and it can't be safe.

499
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,780
And even if it was, I don't think you
could ever sell the public on this.

500
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:59,700
Thank you.

501
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:02,450
I think when people see the
savings on their utility bill

502
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:06,459
and when they see how it saves the
environment, they will be sold.

503
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,760
Microwaves? Are you kidding me?

504
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:11,510
Man, they are brutal.

505
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,630
All right, let's light this candle.

506
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,800
Where the hell have you been?

507
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:19,680
Uh, there's been some developments. You
know how I fucked Melcher's old wife?

508
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:21,979
- I fucked his new wife, too.
- What?

509
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,640
Uh, don't worry, he's not gonna find out.

510
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:26,020
I left way before he got back
last night and then I didn't

511
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:28,319
go back this morning until
20 minutes after he had left.

512
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,819
You went back?

513
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,390
How many times did you fuck this woman?

514
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,730
The old wife or the new wife?

515
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,980
- The new wife.
- Last night or this morning?

516
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:38,030
Erlich, what are you thinking?
This is kind of the big day today.

517
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,990
Relax, he's not gonna find
out. She's not gonna tell him.

518
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,290
How the fuck do you know that?

519
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,620
Because she'd have to be crazy to tell him

520
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:44,660
and I asked her point
blank if she was crazy

521
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:47,830
and she swore to me, no, she's not crazy.

522
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,630
- Pied Piper, you're up.
- Let's do it.

523
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:53,330
The microwaves only penetrate
the top layer of skin cells.

524
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:56,140
I don't believe you. It can't be safe.

525
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:58,140
Thank you.

526
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:01,680
I've been testing it on these
guys all winter and they're fine.

527
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:04,090
Let me just demonstrate it to assure you...

528
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,350
- No! No!
- No! Please!

529
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,930
No one is ever going to buy one of these.

530
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,320
Ever.

531
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:13,850
That was HumanHeater.

532
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:17,199
Next up, Executive Chairman
and Chief Visionary

533
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,110
Erlich Bachman presenting Pied Piper.

534
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,430
Since the dawn of time,

535
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,130
mankind hath sought to make
things smaller, but until now,

536
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:44,270
no man...

537
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,890
You son of a bitch!

538
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,770
Jesus Christ! Everyone remain calm.

539
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,470
Stay in your seats!
Everything is under control!

540
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,940
Lights?

541
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:57,200
I think he knows.

542
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:05,610
