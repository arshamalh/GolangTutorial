1
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:10,787
Richie!

2
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,120
- Right on time.
- Hey. You're the lawyer?

3
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,570
Ron Laflamme. Great to meet you.

4
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,891
All right, homeboy. Pop a squat.

5
00:00:19,892 --> 00:00:21,442
Start autographing by the flags.

6
00:00:21,445 --> 00:00:23,410
Lot of paper to get through.

7
00:00:29,305 --> 00:00:32,250
So, what do you think?

8
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,305
About?

9
00:00:34,307 --> 00:00:36,640
Jeannie. She's pretty hot, right?

10
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,680
Oh. Yeah. No, she's... She's very pretty.

11
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,140
Yeah, she is.

12
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,850
Oh, we're doing that. Ok.

13
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,820
So yo, Peter tells me you're
popping your cherry with this.

14
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:48,070
So let me just walk you through it.

15
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,100
That stuff you're signing gives you

16
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,359
the convertible note for funding

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,940
and establishes you and Peter Gregory

18
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:55,770
as the board members of Pied Piper,

19
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,030
incorporated in the State of Delaware.

20
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,369
Ok. Why Delaware?

21
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:05,200
Rich, Rich. Lawyer, not lawyer. I got you.

22
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:10,760
So, Peter Gregory, big fan of you.

23
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,590
- Oh.
- He invited you to his toga party, right?

24
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,960
That's a big deal. Flo
Rida's gonna be there.

25
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,550
- You like Flo Rida?
- Should be fun.

26
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,719
- Yeah, I went to a lot...
- See this guitar?

27
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,970
Sergei and Larry from Google signed it.

28
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:25,690
- Both of them. Right there.
- Mmm. Mm.

29
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,060
So, Pied Piper.

30
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:31,739
You're one of Peter's
compression plays, huh?

31
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,860
Uhh, one of? How many does he have?

32
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,870
Not too many. Like six or eight.

33
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,120
Ok. Why are there so many?

34
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,790
You know how sea turtles
have a shit-ton of babies

35
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,540
because most of them die on
their way down to the water?

36
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:48,290
Peter just wants to make sure that
his money makes it to the ocean.

37
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,740
But it seems like you
got your shit together.

38
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,580
A lot of these guys come in here

39
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,330
and they can do all of
the engineering stuff

40
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,580
but they get all hung up on technicalities.

41
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,000
They can't just tell you what
their vision for the company is.

42
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,640
Those guys are so fucked.

43
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:03,640
It's like you need both
halves of the brain, right?

44
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:07,260
The Jobs and the Wozniak.
The ying and the yang.

45
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,900
Oh. I think it's "yin".

46
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,480
- "Yin"?
- Yeah.

47
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:16,240
- Like "yin and yan?"
- No. Like yin and yang.

48
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,210
No. It's ying and yang, they're opposites.

49
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,440
So, Pied Piper, drop it on me. What is it?

50
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:25,610
Well, we started off as a music app.

51
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,070
- Yuck.
- Yeah. Gross. Ugh.

52
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,700
But we've,
uh, we've pivoted since then.

53
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,920
Uh-oh. To what?

54
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:38,290
Well, our weissman scores are
consistently high across all media,

55
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,300
audio, video, meta-data.

56
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:43,800
Actually, that's not true. We've
had some trouble encoding 3D video.

57
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:46,180
I think it's because the pixels change
value differently

58
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,875
than conventional...

59
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,999
☯Synced & Corrected by<font color=#80397b> Seppuku17</font>☯
❃<font color=#e796af>www.addic7ed.com</font>❃

60
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,829
Just look at the flow diagram, dude.

61
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:09,620
No, the filter bank is part
of the prediction loop.

62
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:13,380
What are you talking about,
this is lossless compression.

63
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:16,000
Oh, hey, Big Head, you were there.

64
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:19,330
Why did Richard use a DCT filter bank?

65
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:22,090
Oh. Um...

66
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,740
Not really sure. Richard tried
to explain some of this stuff

67
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,349
but a lot of it I didn't really understand,

68
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,680
so I'd kinda just nod and smile, you know?

69
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:32,900
Can you at least help us figure out
this insane DFT spider web he's using?

70
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:40,020
Dude, do you understand any of this?

71
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,080
I eat the fish.

72
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,039
I understand you eat the fish.

73
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,780
But when you clean the fish

74
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,970
you can't leave the fish head
and guts and shit in the sink.

75
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,879
Because the whole house
smells like a bait station.

76
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:00,210
So you gotta put it in the trash
and then take the trash out.

77
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,389
Do you understand?

78
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,389
Yes. I eat the fish.

79
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:07,270
Motherfuck!

80
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,800
Do you know how awkward it is to not
be able to describe your own company?

81
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,350
Like, I built Pied Piper
and you could see it

82
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,770
but I can't really
describe to you what it is

83
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,980
even though I kind of know where I'm going.

84
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:20,060
You do realize we quit working on
our own apps to work for you, right?

85
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:23,700
Shouldn't you more than "Kind
of know where you're going?"

86
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,920
Because that's basically what the CEO does.

87
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,400
I do. Sort of.

88
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:31,249
Ok, it's like trying to
tell someone how to get somewhere,

89
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,320
even though you don't really
know the exact address. Right?

90
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:36,330
Like, how do you do that? Because you
can't just say "Go to 415 elm street,"

91
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,880
because you don't even
know what that is. Right?

92
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:40,580
So you have to say, you know,
"Go straight down that big road

93
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,220
and take a right at the weird thing."

94
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,550
But, you can't describe
what that weird thing is

95
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,929
because you just know it
as a weird thing, you know,

96
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,390
in your head. You always have.

97
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,970
Is that weird thing in
your head an aneurysm?

98
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,890
Richard, I'm just gonna recap for a second,

99
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,260
um, you turned down ten million dollars

100
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:59,070
to be able to develop something that
you, as the head of the company,

101
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,949
can't even describe to another human being?

102
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:05,910
I say this only to motivate you.

103
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,110
Ok, so I have been instructed to remove you

104
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,610
from the list of employees
assigned to the Nucleus project.

105
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:16,920
You will no longer receive any
Nucleus related communications,

106
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,760
uh, file reports, or attend
any Nucleus meetings.

107
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:22,740
Any questions?

108
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:26,139
Uh, no. That's... That's pretty clear.

109
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,730
Great.

110
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,180
Am I being reassigned to something else?

111
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:34,770
Not that I am aware of. At this time. No.

112
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,350
Wait, so then am I being fired?

113
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,819
Because I have a three year
contract and my stock options...

114
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:42,149
Ok. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Nobody is being fired. Ok?

115
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:45,010
Look, a contract is a contract.

116
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:50,370
You know. You've got a contract. And I've
got a contract. We all have contracts.

117
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:54,160
And-and here at Hooli,
contracts are honored.

118
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:57,380
Um... yours and mine.

119
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,250
Everybody's. So, um...

120
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,670
Have I made that perfectly clear?

121
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:04,000
Yeah, no. That's clear.

122
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:11,519
But, when I come into work
tomorrow, what do I... do?

123
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:17,350
That is unclear. At this time.

124
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,400
Shoulda worn more than my
underwear and a bed sheet.

125
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,990
- Underwear? Pussy.
- Yeah. I'm with him.

126
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,910
This is the type of evening
that requires free-balling.

127
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,709
Oh. I'm gonna take my underwear off too.

128
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:40,120
Richard! Hey, you made it!

129
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:45,120
So Peter met with Laflamme
today and signed the paperwork,

130
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:48,389
which means Pied Piper
is officially launched.

131
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:51,850
Uh, why didn't you tell me about all the
other compression plays Peter was seeding?

132
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:56,300
What? No... because it's
nothing you need to worry about.

133
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,899
Because none of those other
companies have your vision.

134
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,110
- My vision?
- Exactly.

135
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,310
Speaking of which, Peter really
wants you to come in on Friday

136
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,810
to chat about big picture stuff.

137
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,530
You know, lay out your
vision in broad strokes.

138
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,610
- Broad strokes... For the vision of the...
- Uh-huh.

139
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,700
Well, uh, Pied Piper is
compression and we all know that.

140
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:15,740
So we don't need to talk about that...
but I could because I'm the CEO.

141
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:21,419
Pied Piper takes the data...
And... smaller. To smaller.

142
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:24,250
And, also, there's more.

143
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:28,330
- It compresses the data overall...
- Yeah, I...

144
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:32,140
Excuse me. See you Friday. Hi Tom.

145
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,810
Richard, pace yourself, buddy.

146
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:45,230
You know, I wish this was
Roman times. You know?

147
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,820
Life was simpler back then.

148
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:49,320
Simpler for you. I would have been a slave.

149
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:52,570
There's still time.

150
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:56,580
Cool costume. Where'd you get it?

151
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:58,660
Uhh...

152
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:00,280
Uh, my bed.

153
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:03,290
- You're funny!
- Oh.

154
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,290
I'm Brooke and this is my friend Anastasia.

155
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,840
Hi.

156
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:09,299
- Hi.
- What's up, guys?

157
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,090
Uh...

158
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,340
So-so-so, how do you know Peter Gregory?

159
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,639
- Oh, through work.
- Mm-hmm.

160
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,130
We're actresses.

161
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:20,640
Cool. Uh, what type of actressing you work?

162
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,190
Oh, we're working right now.

163
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,310
Our startup sources actors
to parties to liven things up

164
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:30,150
and get into conversations with
guests and be interested in them.

165
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,489
Oh. Neat.

166
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:35,230
So, uh, who else is paid to be here?

167
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,620
Pretty much anyone that's
over a seven is with us,

168
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,999
and anyone that's under a three is a guest.

169
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,620
- It's a really fun job. Plus,
- Yeah.

170
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:48,160
Um, I get to work with my boyfriend.

171
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:49,929
- - Yo, yo, party
people,

172
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,179
y'all ready to get crazy?

173
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,300
Is that Flo Rida?

174
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,771
- No idea.
- Y'all ready to take this party

175
00:08:55,772 --> 00:08:57,770
to a whole 'nother level?

176
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:00,390
It's time to meet the
original O.G. Gangster,

177
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,019
cash money mobster.

178
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,350
Y'all put your hands
together for my brother!

179
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:09,480
The illest, the chillest, emperor
of Rome, big Pete Gregory!

180
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,375
He is the illest and the chillest?

181
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:33,840
Big Pete Gregory!

182
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:36,290
Thank you, Florida.

183
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,930
Welcome to the Peter Gregory foundation's

184
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,520
fourth annual orgy of caring.

185
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:47,050
The first three were fine.

186
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:50,360
I hope that you enjoy the party.

187
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:55,230
There is a second bar in back

188
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,450
where the line is much shorter.

189
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:01,740
Thank you. I'm finished.

190
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,570
That was very abrupt.

191
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:18,970
- So this is a rap concert?
- Yep.

192
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:22,140
Holy shit, look at Erlich!

193
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:26,269
How the fuck did he get up there?

194
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,650
Man. See, that's what I wish I had.

195
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,600
It's like, I don't have any...

196
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:33,350
- Game.
- Game, yes! That's it.

197
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,650
You know, I always knew
I was missing something

198
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,070
and then someone explained
to me the concept of game,

199
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:45,830
I remember very distinctly thinking,
"That's what I don't have. Game."

200
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,167
Sorry.

201
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,670
- Hello?
- What's up, Richie Rich?

202
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,649
Great seeing you last night, buddy.

203
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,640
Just wanted you to know I had my associate

204
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:15,230
draft up everything like we
talked about and it is all good.

205
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,230
Just emailed you the board consent
which appoints your new board member.

206
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,620
So just print it, sign it, get it
to Gregory to sign and it is donezo.

207
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,740
Uh, new board member, what?

208
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,570
It's in the pdf, you'll see.

209
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:30,020
All right, homey, I gotta
go. My enema guy is here.

210
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:35,630
Gary! Namaste!

211
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,970
Pied Piper incorporated
amended board of directors.

212
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:43,800
Richard Hendricks, Peter
Gregory... Erlich Bachman?

213
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,420
Oh, my God.

214
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:49,340
Is sleeping beauty awake?

215
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,480
Yes, she is.

216
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:55,689
Oh, boy. Here, I brought you
something for your stomach.

217
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:59,029
Be forewarned, the orange
juice has vodka in it.

218
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:01,240
Little hair of the dog.

219
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:05,660
What exactly happened last
night, from your side?

220
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:08,200
We happened, Richard. And the best part is,

221
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:11,500
we can relive it whenever we want to.

222
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:15,620
We're two halves of the same brain!

223
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:18,379
Whoa! You complete me!

224
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:21,280
Don't ever say that again!
Do you understand me?

225
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:22,889
I will beat the shit out of you.

226
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,550
Yo, yo, get that camera out my face.

227
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,210
- Come on, Mr... Ok, ok.
- Get the camera out my face!

228
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,229
- Look at this part.
- I'm asking this fat,

229
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,740
beautiful man

230
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,520
In front of God and the Flo Rider

231
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:36,220
and this white, weird cocaine statue

232
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:41,110
- to be on the Pied Piper board of directors.
- Yes!

233
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,570
- A thousand times, yes!
- He's doin' it!

234
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:46,150
- Shake on it.
- It's a deal.

235
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,036
Oh, no.

236
00:12:48,037 --> 00:12:50,249
Plus, we have this for
the Pied Piper documentary

237
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,710
that we're eventually gonna make.

238
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,290
We're making history together, partner.

239
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:00,330
Are you dressed like Steve Jobs?

240
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,300
Oh, am I?

241
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:05,480
Well, I suppose Steve and I always
have shared a similar aesthetic.

242
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:25,440
Hey. Little help?

243
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,860
Oh. Ok.

244
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,960
- Here you go.
- Thanks, man.

245
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:52,449
- Sorry about the throw. Bursitis.
- Yeah.

246
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:55,440
Uh, so, you guys having a meeting up here?

247
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,520
No. Not exactly.

248
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:03,890
We're all currently... unassigned.

249
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,819
How about you?

250
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,700
- Yeah. Unassigned.
- Yeah.

251
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,780
That's cool.

252
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,159
Yeah.

253
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,990
How could you put Erlich on the board?

254
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,460
What were you thinking?

255
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,999
You don't put someone inside
the company on the board.

256
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,839
Then he and Peter Gregory can vote you out.

257
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:22,830
Yeah. You gotta find an outsider
you trust. Like your mom.

258
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:28,140
I'd put Erlich on the board
before my mom. Backstabbing bitch.

259
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,840
Guys, I was drunk, ok?

260
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:32,090
You know, I half-jokingly
said to Gilfoyle last night.

261
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,349
"It looks like Richard is
going to suck Erlich's dick."

262
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,349
But that would be
reasonable compared to this.

263
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:39,510
Richard, um, could I speak to you?

264
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:48,020
Ok. Yeah.

265
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:50,790
He's the least cool guy I've ever met.

266
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,030
I heard about what's been happening.

267
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,610
I have to say, I'm a little disappointed.

268
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:59,250
Yeah, I don't... I don't
know what I was thinking.

269
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,170
Yes. I mean, um,

270
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:04,460
is there a reason I wasn't
invited to the party?

271
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,970
Is there some sense that
I'm not part of the gang?

272
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,790
What? Uh, Jared.

273
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,510
Of course not. It was just an oversight.

274
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,970
I mean, we weren't even
sure if we were gonna go.

275
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:19,520
Uh-huh. And what was it like there?

276
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:21,720
Were there gelatin shots?

277
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:26,310
No. No, uh, it was stupid and loud.

278
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,810
Uh, honestly, you're better off.

279
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,360
I suppose. I had a fine night.

280
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:35,200
I... I had some palak paneer and I
watched a documentary about Liberia.

281
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:40,070
But then I woke up to this,
um, unexpected development.

282
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,589
Do you... do you really
want Erlich on the board?

283
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:46,080
- Because I'll support you...
- No. I don't. At all.

284
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:49,050
I was just drunk.

285
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,720
I don't know how to get out of it.

286
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:52,890
I mean, what am I going
to say to Peter Gregory?

287
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:56,599
Well, if you don't sign the documents,
and you don't give them to Peter Gregory,

288
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,599
then it won't happen. Simple as that.

289
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:03,260
Really? I... Wow. Ok.

290
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:08,650
That is a relief, Jared. Thanks.

291
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,020
I'm... I'm glad you're around.

292
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:14,070
Well, keep that in mind for future parties.

293
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:18,360
Honestly, sometimes we forget you're here.

294
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,280
- Oh...
- You guys, company photo time

295
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:21,620
out back. Let's go!

296
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:24,670
Uh, Gilfoyle, ok, off to
the center a little bit.

297
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,170
Like your personality. No, no, no, no.

298
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,370
Dinesh, leave it unbuttoned.
We want you to look like shit.

299
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,930
Makes for a better "before" photo.

300
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,710
But you're wearing a jacket.

301
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,010
Yeah, because I'm the genius marketer.

302
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,100
I'm not a code freak like you guys.

303
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:40,470
Besides, I'm wearing sandals so
I am iconoclasting a little bit.

304
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,190
Oh, good. Jared. Ugh. What
the fuck is with that vest?

305
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,360
Right over here. As if you're
sort of a late addition

306
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:50,360
that may not stick around for the
entire duration of the company.

307
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:53,310
And then, Richard. There
you go. The man of the hour.

308
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,070
Ok. We'll take a few like this,

309
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,620
and then... Just Richard and I.

310
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:00,960
Because at the end of the day,

311
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:04,610
people only want to see a
picture of the board members.

312
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:08,800
It... Actually, it's, um...

313
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:10,750
You're not gonna be a board member.

314
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,050
What?

315
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,420
I'm in year three of a five year deal

316
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:18,310
and, Matt, you got what,
like three years left?

317
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,390
Yeah. We all got acquired by Hooli,

318
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,930
when we didn't work out,
none of us got reassigned.

319
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:28,480
Because Gavin believes in this
Japanese form of management

320
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:31,850
where not being assigned is
the most shameful outcome.

321
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,440
Yeah, it does feel uncomfortable.

322
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:39,190
Nah. Give it a week or two,
you'll get, like, numb to it.

323
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,910
Well, why are you guys still coming in?

324
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,030
Rest and vest.

325
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,750
Oh... because in order to
fully vest your options,

326
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,379
you've gotta wait until
your contracts are up.

327
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,840
- I get it.
- You catch on slow.

328
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,210
You'll fit right in here.

329
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:56,049
Lunch? Arby's on El Camino? I'll drive.

330
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:58,350
No, let's walk. It'll take longer.

331
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,460
Gotta do something to fill the day, right?

332
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,550
I was drunk! You took advantage of me!

333
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,440
Man, they are really going at it.

334
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:09,899
So, um... last night, what
was the girl situation?

335
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,001
Shhh.

336
00:18:11,002 --> 00:18:12,569
And after all I've given
up for this company.

337
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:14,450
Oh, what have you given up?

338
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,950
I owned ten percent of Dinesh's
app, ten percent of Gilfoyle's app.

339
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,030
- Multiple potential streams of income.
- Sure.

340
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,740
Not to mention that a
hundred percent of the team

341
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,870
that you have, were all guys
that I recruited for this house.

342
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,414
That must be worth something to me.

343
00:18:27,415 --> 00:18:29,849
It is! Ten percent of Pied Piper!

344
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:32,150
For which I forewent,
yes, that's a real word,

345
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,980
- one million dollars.
- Mmm.

346
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,990
I supported you, Richard. I bet on you.

347
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,490
And now you're just gonna give me a seat
on the board, only to retract that offer?!

348
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,830
I can't even remember doing that!

349
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,160
Oh, really? Well, do you remember this
particular dick-bag I got on video?

350
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:48,960
Because you did.

351
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:51,830
Put it away.

352
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,500
It's right here.

353
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,140
Goddammit.

354
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:57,179
I've seen the video.

355
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,920
It's the wrong album, just give me a sec...

356
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:01,260
You know what? Fuck it!
You offering me a position

357
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,590
on this board and reneging it

358
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,260
is a perfect example of
you having no vision,

359
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,730
no balls and no game.

360
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,320
Maybe he did blow him.

361
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:13,190
Well, love and hate... It's all passion.

362
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,990
And if that's the kind
of company you wanna run,

363
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,320
well, then, fine.

364
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,780
God help you. 'Cause I sure as hell ain't.

365
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,539
Uh, what are you doing?

366
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,950
You give your loyalty to somebody...

367
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,800
- Let me help you.
- Don't touch!

368
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:29,700
- I can do it myself.
- All right.

369
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:33,240
I just put it back on. Goddammit!

370
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:36,719
Ok. Read that back to me.

371
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,600
"Pied Piper's mission is to bring
its unique compression algorithm

372
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,036
- to a variety..."
- One thing you should know about

373
00:19:41,037 --> 00:19:44,059
living in this house is I do
not tolerate substance abuse.

374
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,550
There's no drinking and
lying in this house.

375
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,360
I should have made that more clear
to some of the current residents.

376
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:51,810
Like this one. Don't mind him.

377
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:54,450
He'll be gone soon when his
company cakes its pants.

378
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:58,730
Hopefully, Jurgen, you'll be able to bring
a more positive element to the house.

379
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:02,150
Let me show you the room I'm offering.
Some of his stuff is still in there,

380
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,540
but, as I mentioned, it will soon be gone.

381
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:08,210
Once his company cakes its pants.

382
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,580
It's ok. Just take a breath.

383
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,500
It's fine. I'm fine. Uh, we just...

384
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:14,750
Let's get through this. Ok,
so, read this back to me.

385
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,830
- "Pied Piper's mission..."
- Hey, guys.

386
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,840
Hope you don't mind, the
front door was just open.

387
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,220
Hi, Big Head. What's up?

388
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:25,099
Honestly? Nothing. I've just
been sitting around all day.

389
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,269
Not working. It's weird, you know?

390
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:32,680
Yeah.

391
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,320
So, what's up with you guys?

392
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:36,570
We're just sort of...

393
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:39,070
We're getting ready for this
big Peter Gregory meeting.

394
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,830
And we have... we have a
lot of work to do, so...

395
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,750
Cool. Very cool.

396
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:51,670
You know, Richard, the irony is that
if you had taken the ten million,

397
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,469
you'd be kicking back with a ton of
money right now and I'd still be working.

398
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:58,760
But you didn't, obviously. And
now I've got nothing to do,

399
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:03,460
I'm rolling in it, and
you're working your ass off.

400
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,979
Life's funny isn't it?

401
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,800
You guys want to walk to Arby's,

402
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:14,610
maybe grab a bite, play
a little hacky sack?

403
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:17,819
Yeah. I should probably
get back to work, anyway.

404
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,730
I mean, not work, exactly, I don't...

405
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:25,120
I don't work. But, you know,
just get back to Hooli.

406
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:27,990
Sit around all day and get paid
a bunch of money to do nothing.

407
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,990
Weird.

408
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,669
You ready?

409
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,830
You know what you're going to
say? You want to run it by me?

410
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,050
No, no. I got this. Fuck Erlich.

411
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:42,349
You know, I turned down ten million
dollars to build this thing.

412
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:45,560
You want vision, I will
show you fucking vision.

413
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:49,010
I like this new angry side to you.

414
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,150
Being around angry people relaxes me,

415
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,010
because I know where I stand.

416
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,850
Oh, shoot. I think I got
something stuck in my teeth.

417
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,815
I'm just gonna go to the bathroom,
check it out. I'll be back in a sec.

418
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:20,380
Richard, it's Jared. Are you ok?

419
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:33,550
Hey buddy, what's... going on here?

420
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,060
I thought I had something in my teeth,

421
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:39,530
but when I looked over, right? I
looked in the mirror like this,

422
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,480
uh, my pants they hit the countertop,

423
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,570
and it must have some
water on there, right?

424
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:46,239
So I got a spot on my pants, kinda looked
like I pissed myself like a big baby.

425
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,290
So what I did was, I just
took off all my pants

426
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,450
and I put it in the water just
to make it all completely wet.

427
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,120
You know, that way I figured
no one would really notice.

428
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:54,419
So, you know, it wouldn't be as
bad. I've got it under control.

429
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,790
I've sorted it out. We're good.

430
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,589
Yes. So you felt this wouldn't look as bad.

431
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:02,089
- Understood.
- Yeah.

432
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:05,250
But, Richard? Um...

433
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:09,090
Consider that maybe this might not
be the best choice for the meeting?

434
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:12,980
Yeah. Holy...

435
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,760
What the fuck am I doing?

436
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:17,900
I can't go like this to the meeting.

437
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:19,439
Jared. I have no vision.

438
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,650
Yes, you do.

439
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:24,520
- I believe in you...
- No, no, I literally have no vision.

440
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:28,030
All I see is stars and swirls.
I cannot see right now.

441
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,530
Ok, let's get your pants on.

442
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,860
Jared? Richard? Are you in there?

443
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:36,080
Ohh.

444
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:38,290
Hey, there's some weather over the ocean

445
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,200
so Peter would love to get
started. Are you guys ready?

446
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,290
Yep. All good. Be there in a jiffy.

447
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,710
- Ok.
- Oh.

448
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,510
Jared, I'm on a carpet in a bathroom.

449
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,550
Yeah, ok. Um, I know this
isn't the best thing to say

450
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,470
to someone having a panic attack,

451
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,520
but we need to hurry here.

452
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:58,649
- Doing ok?
- Yes, much better.

453
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:02,030
Nope. Worse.

454
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,530
Richard, you're gonna listen to me
if you know what's good for you.

455
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,694
- Erlich.
- I may have been wrong

456
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:07,569
about being a board member

457
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:10,570
and I may be wrong about being the
Steve Jobs in our relationship.

458
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:13,650
But I do know this, you
are the Steve Wozniak.

459
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,870
And no Woz should go into
a meeting like that alone.

460
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,244
- No. Actually...
- So if you'll just let me come in,

461
00:24:20,245 --> 00:24:21,889
then I won't speak.

462
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:24,300
And I just think you should
have somebody in there

463
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:27,630
who will actually have your back.

464
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,250
Ok. No, I... Erlich, I
want you to be in there.

465
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,170
Ok... wait, what?

466
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,840
Yes, and I need you to do all the talking.

467
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:36,390
Because I feel like if I do I'm
gonna puke all over Peter Gregory.

468
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,980
Oh, ok. Wow.

469
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:41,350
That was easier than I... All the talking?

470
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,529
Oh, Erlich, you're here too?

471
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:47,320
- Ok. Come on in, guys.
- Um, I'm going to stay here, I think.

472
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:50,520
Because I look absurd.

473
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,940
Yeah. Yeah, ok.

474
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:57,450
- So what are you going to say?
- Fuck, I don't know.

475
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:05,460
Today's user wants access
to all of their files

476
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:08,090
from all their devices instantly.

477
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,510
That's why cloud-based is the holy grail.

478
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,559
Now Dropbox is winning,

479
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,460
but when it comes to audio and video files,

480
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:17,050
they might as well be called Dripbox.

481
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:24,640
Using our platform, Pied Piper users
would be able to compress all their files

482
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:29,239
to the point where they truly
can access them instantly.

483
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,060
We control the pipe,

484
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,820
they just use it.

485
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:35,617
That's the vision in
Richard Hendricks' head.

486
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:48,020
Sure.

487
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:50,590
Sounds fine.

488
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,929
Oh, I received an email from Ron Laflamme

489
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:58,430
saying that this gentleman

490
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,900
is going to be our third board member?

491
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:04,770
Uhh...

492
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,900
Yes. Yes.

493
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:10,650
Uh, Erlich helped me with all
this stuff. He's very talented.

494
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:14,660
I need him as a partner.

495
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:16,842
Fine.

496
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,799
It's ok for you to leave now.

497
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:32,340
All right, ok.

498
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:36,480
Wait, is that you and Gavin Belson?

499
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:39,470
Yes. It's an old photograph.

500
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,700
Were you guys friends?

501
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:44,390
I thought so.

502
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:49,610
Good-bye.

503
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,610
How'd it go?

504
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:54,650
That was amazing. I mean, that was like
everything in my head but, like, clear.

505
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,780
Did you just make that up on the spot?

506
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:59,829
Yeah. We should probably
write some of it down.

507
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:02,999
Yeah. Well, look. I gotta be honest,

508
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,669
I mean, I can't tell
you how much this means.

509
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:08,460
You really saved my ass even
after I was such a dick to you.

510
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:10,670
- You're making up!
- What else could I do, Richard?

511
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,420
You're my Wozniak.

512
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:17,150
And I will always be...

513
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,649
Motherfu...

514
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:29,650
