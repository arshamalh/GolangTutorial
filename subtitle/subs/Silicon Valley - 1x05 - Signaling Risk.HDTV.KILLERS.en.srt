1
00:00:13,825 --> 00:00:16,400
It's a fucking sketchy neighborhood, man.

2
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,349
You see that guy? That's Chuy Ramirez.

3
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:22,349
And he's gonna do our new logo.

4
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,390
That's the artist you were talking about?

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,090
You said he had paintings in galleries.

6
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,850
His works hang in the
gallery of the streets.

7
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,850
- I'll be back in a flash.
- Whoa, no. What?

8
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,689
OK.

9
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:38,850
Man, we're just going
to sit here like this?

10
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,199
Oh, shit. Look at this guy.

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,860
He's a scary individual.

12
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:48,860
- Whoa. Um...
- Hey, buddy. Do you have any drugs?

13
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:50,920
Please, let it up. Let it up.

14
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:52,330
If you don't let it go, I can't roll it up.

15
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,549
Just... please... Just, you...

16
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,010
Fucking prick! Ow!

17
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,590
I'm gonna beat you in your face!

18
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,430
Chuy Ramirez? Erlich Bachman.

19
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,030
- We spoke on the phone?
- What's up, man?

20
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,710
- Pleasure to meet you.
- All right.

21
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,889
This is great. Look at this.

22
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:10,390
This is what we need, you know
what I mean? Something raw.

23
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,770
We already have kind of a
shitty name, Pied Piper,

24
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,720
but the last thing we want is
two lowercase P's in a square

25
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:18,230
like those motherfuckers
across the freeway would make.

26
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,211
This is what we want?

27
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:21,369
So you gonna give me
stock options, or what?

28
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:24,230
- What?
- Yeah. You know Dave Cho?

29
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,120
He did the murals over at Facebook.

30
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,749
He got a stock option deal, ended up
making like a hundred million dollars.

31
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,160
I want a deal like that.

32
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:33,240
You know, I don't really speak
all that Wall Street bullshit.

33
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,460
You know what I'm saying?

34
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,300
We're just like five guys
hanging out in a house,

35
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:37,550
trying to make cool shit.

36
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,420
Well, you told me you
own ten percent of it,

37
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,550
so you must know something about it, right?

38
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,250
You could just give me some of your points.

39
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,750
Hey, I'm not an accountant, you know?

40
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,510
I don't even know what that means,

41
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,510
a lot of those words.

42
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:54,830
You fucking prick!

43
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:01,490
Oh, you fucker.

44
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,740
Let me in. Please, please...

45
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,119
I'll break this. I don't
care. I don't care.

46
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,770
- I'll break this...
- I can't hear you.

47
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,949
Oh God.

48
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,940
I can't hear you.

49
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,500
Yeah, but you don't want
stock in our company.

50
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,620
If I could go back in time, I
wouldn't have taken the stock.

51
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,920
I would've taken cash
only. I'm telling you...

52
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,960
Who's that dude?

53
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,340
- Uh, nobody. He's a coder.
- You got a Latino working for you?

54
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:27,300
That's cool, yo. Not a lot
of Latinos working in tech.

55
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,139
Yeah. Yeah, he's Latino.

56
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:33,020
Yeah, and he's one of
the best coders we have.

57
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,770
Kind of adds a Latin flair to the company.

58
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,710
I told you, we do things differently.

59
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,810
Yeah. You know what?

60
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,280
I could do a cash deal
for a Latino company.

61
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,650
I think we should get out of here, though,

62
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,989
because I just painted
over some dude's shit

63
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,150
and people get shot behind that.

64
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,150
So I'll catch you on the flip. Peace!

65
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:55,660
Uh, OK. Peace, Chuy.

66
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,080
Oh, God. This is...

67
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,210
This is very real!

68
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,339
Hey, Dinesh! Get in the fucking car.

69
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,674
There may be a drive-by about to happen.

70
00:03:02,675 --> 00:03:03,706
What?

71
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:15,099

72
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,680
You promised this guy ten thousand dollars

73
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,189
without any approval?

74
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,520
- Are you high?
- A little bit, yeah.

75
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:22,480
But that's irrelevant.

76
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:25,029
A cool company needs a cool logo.

77
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,270
You think those guys over
at Nucleus are hiring

78
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,740
a convicted felon to paint
a mural on their garage?

79
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,369
For ten thousand dollars? No.

80
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:35,539
Look, I took a run at a burn-down chart.

81
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:42,840
Jesus fucking Christ.

82
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:43,960
It's not pretty.

83
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,170
The way things are going,

84
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,880
we're not gonna finish for five months,

85
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,380
and even with everyone on reduced salaries,

86
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,180
we'll exhaust all our funding in four.

87
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,680
And that's without wasting ten
thousand dollars on artwork.

88
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,430
"Wasting"? I got a great deal.

89
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,940
You know he wanted stock
options until he saw Dinesh?

90
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,940
- Hold on, what?
- Don't be offended,

91
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:04,399
but for some weird reason,
Chuy took a look at you

92
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,560
and thought you were... a Mexican.

93
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,270
Why would I be offended by that?

94
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,124
- What?
- Why would I be offended

95
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,635
by him thinking I'm Mexican?

96
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,150
He's Mexican, right?

97
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,040
Yeah, he is, but you're
not. You're Pakistani.

98
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,410
So? Actually,

99
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:23,410
the very fact that you think
this would be offensive to me

100
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,160
is offensive.

101
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:26,509
You're the one being racist.

102
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,170
No. I'm not the one who
called you a Mexican.

103
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,710
"Called me a Mexican"?
You're doing it again.

104
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,969
I'm bending over backwards
to not be racist right now.

105
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,580
All right. Well, what did he say
when you told him I wasn't Mexican?

106
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:41,710
- I didn't.
- And why not?

107
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,309
Because I wanted him to
paint our garage for cheap.

108
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:48,470
I... I genuinely don't know
how to respond to that.

109
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,020
You know, I'm not gonna take the bait here.

110
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:51,649
I am not a racist, all right?

111
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:56,060
I watch a lot of black porn. I mean, a lot.

112
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,700
One question.

113
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:00,530
In this porn, is the man black,

114
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,240
or the woman black, or are they both?

115
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,210
Is one of those racist,
and the others aren't?

116
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,290
I'll hack his browser history.
We'll get to the bottom of this.

117
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,490
Yep.

118
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,500
Hold on. That's unnecessary.

119
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,580
Hold on.

120
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:14,550
Richard?

121
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,670
Can you explain this to me?

122
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,000
Hmm? What?

123
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,340
I just got a text from
my friend at TechCrunch.

124
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,970
Pied Piper just got into this
year's Start-Up Battlefield?

125
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,090
Oh, really? Oh, that's so cool.

126
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,230
No. No, it isn't. We're
already seeded, Richard.

127
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,010
Why would we enter a start-up
competition at a tech conference?

128
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,180
I sent in the application a few months ago

129
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,600
and I totally forgot about it.

130
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,520
Relax, I will withdraw.

131
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:40,490
Relax? This house is chaos.

132
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,430
I gave up a great job and stock
options at Hooli to come here

133
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,610
because I thought Pied
Piper could be viable,

134
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,200
but it never will be unless
we make some changes.

135
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:50,120
We need to operate like a business

136
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,540
or we're not going to...

137
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,927
Richard? Richard?

138
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,590
Thanks for coming in, Nelson.

139
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,800
Mr. Belson is very
excited to meet with you.

140
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:06,600
I thought he was in Jackson Hole this week.

141
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:09,440
Yes, he is. We're going to
call him up on the TeleHuman.

142
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:14,220
It's amazing. It's holographic 3D
teleconferencing technology that we've acquired.

143
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:16,140
It's going to feel as
if Gavin is right here

144
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,899
in the room with you.

145
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,150
Oh, it's him!

146
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,700
It's him!

147
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:26,490
Hello, Nelson. Thanks for meeting with me.

148
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,490
Whoa. Hi. That's cool.

149
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,740
Am I a hologram over there too?

150
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,410
What? No, of course not.

151
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:36,410
do you still talk to Richard Hendricks?

152
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:40,670
Uh, yeah. I mean, not about
Nucleus or anything...

153
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,050
Why would he enter Pied
Piper in TechCrunch Disrupt?

154
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,429
I know a lot of big players
have come out of it,

155
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,890
Dropbox, Yammer, what have you.

156
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,920
But Peter Gregory's already funding him.

157
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:51,730
Why would he let Richard
do this? It makes no sense.

158
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,760
I don't know. I didn't
even know Richard got in.

159
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,820
Is Peter Gregory toying with me?

160
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,850
Is he trying to make Richard seem folksy?

161
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,990
Like some aw-shucks boy-genius

162
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,990
entering an everyman's competition?

163
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,020
Mr. Bel... Mr. Belson?

164
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,690
- Can you hear me?
- Hello?

165
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,450
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah, it's just...

166
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,780
- It's sort of fading.
- Hel-l-l-lo?

167
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:12,950
- Hello.
- Hello-ooo.

168
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,559
I'm hearing you, it's just the image is...

169
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,629
Nelson, shut up for a second.

170
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:18,420
If you can hear me, make a gesture.

171
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,510
Is that... do you... I hear you.

172
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,710
- Is this...
- I have no idea what you're saying, Nelson.

173
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,840
...Nelson. Nelson.

174
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,590
Can you help me, please?

175
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,140
OK, I think what happened
was when you set it up,

176
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,809
- you forgot to...
- I didn't set it up.

177
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:37,110
I paid one of you people
to set it up. Just fix it.

178
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,460
Uh... OK.

179
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:43,200
Here's the thing, it's not working.

180
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:46,980
Um, the audio's still working.
You could just use that.

181
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,320
"The audio is working"? Excuse me?!

182
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:52,710
I paid twenty million fucking
dollars to acquire this company!

183
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,460
Fuck you, the audio is working!

184
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:57,240
Audio worked a hundred fucking years ago!

185
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,669
You fucking piece of shit-t-t-t...

186
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,130
- It appears we've lost him.
- Yeah.

187
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:09,170
- Why don't we just Hooli-Chat instead?
- Yeah.

188
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,640
Ah. That's better.

189
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:16,050
Sorry. The TeleHuman is a
great piece of technology.

190
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:19,250
Unfortunately, the broadband isn't
that great out here in rural Wyoming.

191
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,850
That presents a great business opportu...

192
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,410
Nelson, make a gesture... hear me.

193
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,410
Oh, for fuck's sake.

194
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:34,650
Uh... I think you forgot
to update your software.

195
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:40,090
God dammit. Fu...!

196
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:46,630
Oh.

197
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,050
Hello. Oh, hi, Gavin.

198
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,889
What's that? I'm sorry,

199
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:53,270
you're kind of breaking up there.

200
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,850
He... Hello? Hello?

201
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,190
OK, let's start the meeting.

202
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,069
I think we need to define
our corporate culture.

203
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:04,110
Our whole corporate culture
is that we don't have

204
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,560
a corporate culture.

205
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,409
That is totally ridiculous, Gilfoyle.

206
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,480
The main reason dogs are perceived to have

207
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:12,450
a more keen sense of smell is because
their noses are closer to the ground.

208
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,870
Therefore, with a little practice,

209
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,210
I could easily have as keen
a sense of smell as a dog's.

210
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,140
Guys? I guess you didn't see the sign.

211
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,740
We're actually having a meeting here.

212
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,160
Congratulations.

213
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:28,170
It's sort of for management only.

214
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,000
Are you fucking serious right now?

215
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,190
Are you really kicking us out?

216
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,420
Well, I thought, maybe you guys could just

217
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,269
take your food into the living room?

218
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:36,560
So you want to have a meeting in
the room where all the food is,

219
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:39,060
while we eat our food in the room
where all of the computers are?

220
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:42,325
Guys, just five minutes. Please?

221
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,770
OK, you see? This...
This is a case in point.

222
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,490
This is a company,

223
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,740
and yet we have no
boundaries and no protocol.

224
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,160
We need to establish a
clear corporate culture

225
00:09:58,170 --> 00:09:59,620
or we're not gonna make it.

226
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,580
Take Dinesh and Gilfoyle.

227
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:04,629
They are wasting an enormous
amount of time arguing.

228
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,129
What if we were to separate them, right?

229
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:09,170
Divide their existing
work space into two areas.

230
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,290
We could put in some kind
of portable barrier...

231
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,130
He's talking about cubicles!

232
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,809
We are not doing cubicles. No way!

233
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,850
No, no, no. Don't think of it as a cubicle.

234
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,850
Just think of it as a
neutral-colored enclosure,

235
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:26,240
about yay-high, around your workspace.

236
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,280
OK, fine. But do you
know who uses cubicles?

237
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:31,150
Every single Fortune 500 company.

238
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,450
Why? Because they work.

239
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,900
He's trying to turn us into
corporate rock, Richard.

240
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:38,320
- No.
- We are punk rock.

241
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:40,990
Actually, you know, I think a
better analogy would be jazz.

242
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,330
Like we riff and improvise
around a central theme

243
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,880
to create one cohesive piece of music...

244
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:47,580
No, no. They teach
fucking jazz at Juilliard.

245
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,550
We're not jazz. We're fucking punk rock.

246
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,340
You see? You see, you guys are arguing over

247
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:55,050
what metaphor to use to
agree with each other.

248
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,640
This is the inefficiency
I'm trying to eliminate.

249
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:02,850
My suggestions could actually
help you beat me in this argument.

250
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:06,980
Do you see the irony there?

251
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,110
I... I can't argue with this.

252
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,240
Yo, Erlich!

253
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,780
Uh, Chuy's here.

254
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:21,580
No. And this, this... This
is the craziest one of all.

255
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,879
I mean, we're really about
to spend ten thousand dollars

256
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,090
on-on-on a logo we could
generate in-house for free?

257
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,040
It's madness. You want a logo?

258
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:32,790
Here, just...

259
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,680
There. I just saved this
company ten thousand dollars.

260
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,559
Are you fucking serious? Lowercase letters?

261
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,680
Twitter: lowercase "t".
Google: lowercase "g".

262
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,550
Facebook: lowercase "f".

263
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,720
Every fucking company in the
Valley has lowercase letters.

264
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:49,610
Why? Because it's safe.

265
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,810
But we aren't going to do that.

266
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,780
We're gonna go with Chuy.

267
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,730
Unless any of you gringos
wants to go out there

268
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,620
and tell a guy with
three assault convictions

269
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,070
that we're not gonna give him
the money we promised him.

270
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,410
Hm? That's what I thought.

271
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:09,330
I mean... God.

272
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,750
Are you still enjoying your asparagus, sir?

273
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,330
I was never enjoying it.

274
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:17,670
I only eat it for the nutrients.

275
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,270
You may take it.

276
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,060
Oh, shit.

277
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:28,269
Peter, I don't want to upset you,

278
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:34,070
but Gavin Belson just walked in.

279
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,530
Does he see us?

280
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,000
I don't know. He must
know that you're here.

281
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:47,250
If I scurry to the restroom,
do you imagine he would...

282
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,620
Peter!

283
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,540
I didn't know you came here.

284
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:57,090
Gavin. Hello.

285
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,969
Nice to see you.

286
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:04,050
And you, as well.

287
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,220
How are you?

288
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:07,690
Well.

289
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,979
And you?

290
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,649
Not bad.

291
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:13,319
I just got back from Jackson Hole.

292
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,440
Have you been?

293
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:17,560
I have not.

294
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:22,530
But I hear good things.

295
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,650
You look well. Are you exercising?

296
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:28,210
I have begun to do Pilates.

297
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:33,800
Well... I hear that's good.

298
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,160
I like it.

299
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:39,009
Yes.

300
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:41,390
Well, I didn't mean to interrupt.

301
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,920
Nice to see you, Peter.

302
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:50,760
- Goodbye now.
- OK.

303
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:53,189
You know, I almost forgot.

304
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:56,029
I saw that Pied Piper

305
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:58,650
is in the Start-Up Battlefield
at TechCrunch Disrupt.

306
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,199
It inspired me to call TechCrunch

307
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,369
and offer to be their keynote speaker.

308
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,280
They were quite accommodating.

309
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:08,369
Especially when I said
that I'd make the event

310
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:10,450
the grand unveiling of Nucleus.

311
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:14,590
So, I will see you all at the conference.

312
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,719
This is displeasing.

313
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,210
I have never seen him so incensed.

314
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,100
What the hell were you thinking, Richard?

315
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:31,140
How could you not tell us you
entered TechCrunch Disrupt?

316
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,060
I applied before I even met you guys.

317
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:35,360
I wasn't gonna say anything
because I was gonna withdraw.

318
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:38,140
- No, you're not.
- I'm not? Why not?

319
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:42,560
Because of you, Gavin Belson
is debuting Nucleus at TCD.

320
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:45,700
If you pull out, it looks like
Peter is running away from Gavin.

321
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:48,450
So like it or not, you
are presenting a live demo

322
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,490
in front of the world in eight weeks.

323
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,240
A live demo of what?

324
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,410
I entered TCD with an
early build of Pied Piper,

325
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,250
when it was still just a music app.

326
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,960
No. Sorry. Executive decision,
we are not doing TechCrunch.

327
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:02,330
OK. So let me just tell
you what's gonna happen.

328
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,429
Peter will pull all of his support

329
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,250
and pass on any further funding,

330
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:09,170
which, as you know, is the most
flaming signaling risk on earth.

331
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,599
You'll burn through the
rest of your runway,

332
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,100
no one will step in, then you'll go bust.

333
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,980
I don't get it.

334
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,350
Doesn't Peter Gregory want
what's best for the company?

335
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:27,330
Look. I'm going to be straight with you.

336
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:30,619
Peter Gregory doesn't care.

337
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:33,370
- About...?
- You.

338
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,670
Wait. Just him or both of us?

339
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,040
Any of you. Pied Piper.

340
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:40,790
OK...

341
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,460
Uh, well, then why did he back us?

342
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,460
Does he just want to piss off Gavin Belson?

343
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:48,970
- He spent two hundred thousand dollars just to...
- Yeah, that's nothing!

344
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:52,970
Peter would spend millions
just to mildly annoy Gavin.

345
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,640
These are billionaires, Richard.

346
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:56,610
Humiliating each other
is worth more to them

347
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,060
than we'll make in a lifetime.

348
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:00,940
I see.

349
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:03,780
And you conveniently forgot
to mention any of this

350
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,319
when you were convincing me

351
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,400
to turn down ten million dollars?

352
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:09,820
And now I'm in the middle
of some pissing contest

353
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,290
between two billionaires.

354
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,290
In fairness,

355
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,329
Gavin only offered you
the ten million dollars

356
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:17,130
because we started pursuing you...

357
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,630
But he offered it to me,
Monica! He offered it to me.

358
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,630
Ten million dollars and I didn't take it.

359
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,580
Because you came to me when
I was puking and freaking out

360
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:27,590
and told me that Peter
Gregory believed in me,

361
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,720
when in reality, he didn't
even give a flying fuck!

362
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:31,010
- Richard...
- Oh, my God.

363
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,510
I didn't turn down ten million dollars

364
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,210
because of Peter Gregory, Monica!

365
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:40,980
I turned it down because of you!

366
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:47,070
However angry he is, I
am one-tenth as angry.

367
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,910
Because one of the ten
million would've been mine.

368
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,869
- Because I... I own ten percent.
- I know.

369
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:56,780
- Of Pied Piper...
- I know!

370
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:59,197
It's push.

371
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:11,100
We didn't think we were
going to get this thing done

372
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,889
when we had five months
to do it. Now we have two?

373
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:15,750
Granted, it's not ideal, but
we're just gonna have to...

374
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,059
What the good fuck?

375
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,490
What is happening? Is that Dinesh?

376
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,890
Is that the Statue of Liberty?

377
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:26,530
And it's... There's penetration.

378
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,060
Oh! Hey, neighbor.

379
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:31,780
- Ashley's getting big!
- Aw.

380
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:34,249
She looks... What do we do?

381
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,900
I don't know. Paint over it.

382
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,079
No, no, no. You can't paint over it.

383
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,749
It's like the code of the streets.

384
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,919
People get shot behind that.

385
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,210
- Oh, good.
- Hey. So what do you guys think, man?

386
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,580
Uhh... I think Erlich had a few thoughts.

387
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:49,920
So, I gotta... I'll let you...

388
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:55,390
Uhh...

389
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,590
Here's the headline:

390
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,939
there's a lot right with it.

391
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,260
A lot of good stuff in there.

392
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,270
But I just...

393
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,779
Do you think the piece is working?

394
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:10,240
I mean... Maybe it's a bit
too graphic for the space?

395
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,740
No way. Look at it.

396
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,360
It comments on the Latino
struggle for justice in America.

397
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:15,860
But even without all the symbolism,

398
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:18,250
it's just aesthetically pleasing.

399
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,250
Yeah.

400
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:23,670
All right, here's the real shit, Chuy.

401
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,540
Uh, you know, our prize coder,

402
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:29,120
he's actually not... Latino.

403
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:30,380
What?

404
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:32,710
Yeah. Point of fact is, he's Pakistani.

405
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,960
Homes, you lied to me.

406
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:36,309
No, no, no. You thought he was Latino,

407
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:39,640
and I thought I would be racist
telling you, you were wrong.

408
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,850
Come on, man. Why would you think that?

409
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,970
Thinking that, now that's racist.

410
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,780
God, I can't win... with that.

411
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:51,200
Look, Chuy, painting a
guy named Dinesh Chugtai

412
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:55,489
as an Aztec warrior
just doesn't make sense.

413
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:56,900
Yeah. You know what?

414
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,990
I think you might be right, boss.

415
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,460
Great. That's...

416
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,490
So... Perfect. So change that

417
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,830
and then don't have him be fucking

418
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,830
the literal symbol of freedom.

419
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,080
And then, whatever else you wanna do.

420
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:13,300
- All right.
- All right.

421
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:17,270
If I had known, we could have withdrawn your
application before any of this happened.

422
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,140
This is exactly why we need to have
clearer lines of communication.

423
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,730
I know, Jared, I know.

424
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,730
Listen, I'd like to institute

425
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,680
an organizational system called "scrum."

426
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:27,980
Scrum is designed to...

427
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,850
All right, you have one hour! Go!

428
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,190
No.

429
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,490
No. Just musty.

430
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,910
Uhh, what's going on?

431
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,490
Gilfoyle bet me a hundred bucks

432
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,910
that if I touched one object in this room,

433
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,369
he could find it just by sniffing.

434
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:41,209
OK. Not now, please.

435
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:44,830
It has to be now. I just
masturbated to heighten my focus.

436
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,080
I have a fifteen-minute refractory period.

437
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:49,000
- Ow.
- Uhh, well, we have a lot of work to get done

438
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:51,549
- So maybe we should do that instead, please.
- Dude, relax, OK?

439
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:53,549
We each ripped through a
full module this morning.

440
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:54,760
We're just taking a little break.

441
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:57,300
DRM is now a thing of beauty.

442
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:59,559
Wait. You did DRM?

443
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,470
- Yeah.
- I did DRM.

444
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,050
Why did you do DRM? I said I would
do DRM, you would do error handling.

445
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:08,069
Anything to do with "error"
sounds like your whole vibe.

446
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,440
- Yeah, I handle errors like you every day.
- Scrum?

447
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:13,160
- Yes, scrum.
- Scrum.

448
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:17,070
So from "rules based filtering"
we got to "workflow,"

449
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,700
at which point that card
is moved from the "icebox"

450
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:23,040
into the "in progress"
column and it stays there

451
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,460
until it is ready for "testing."

452
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:27,880
OK. This increases visibility
into our team's progress.

453
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:31,160
And that, gentlemen, is scrum.

454
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:33,580
Welcome to the next
eight weeks of our lives.

455
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,420
This just became a job.

456
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:38,220
OK, so here are the cards

457
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,929
I'm adding under this epic
for the ingestion engine.

458
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:43,269
And there are three stories here.

459
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:46,090
How long do we think each one will take?

460
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:49,760
I don't know. Who cares? Four hours apiece?

461
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,570
Yeah. Maybe for you.

462
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:54,100
Each of those tasks
would take me three max.

463
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,850
Not "tasks," "stories."

464
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,070
I've got a story, why don't
you choke on my balls?

465
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,770
Well, how about this?

466
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:04,330
Why don't you each take one story, right...

467
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,620
and we'll see who's right?

468
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:08,500
You see what he's doing, right?

469
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:11,459
He's trying to get us to
compete so we work faster.

470
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:16,840
He thinks this wall of Psych
101, MBA mind-control bullshit

471
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:18,210
is going to motivate us?

472
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:23,130
Fine. Don't compete. Do them
at whatever speed you like.

473
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,100
Uh, Jared.

474
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:28,890
Uh... I know these guys.

475
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,940
I really don't think scrum
is gonna work for them.

476
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,819
Whoa... Just trust in the system.

477
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:37,110
So we're just going to work at
a nice, leisurely pace, right?

478
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,480
Sure.

479
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:42,370
Wait, why are you typing faster?

480
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,620
I'm not.

481
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:50,040
Maybe my leisurely pace is just
a little faster than yours.

482
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:52,580
Cock-sucker.

483
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,910
Boo-yah.

484
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,339
Guys? Have you been out front yet?

485
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,670
'Cause you might wanna come see this.

486
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,050
- I'm good.
- Fuck off, we're working.

487
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:05,670
Wow. This took a lot of work.

488
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,680
I mean, I'm already smiling.

489
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:09,850
Did he really have to paint
me giving the thumbs-up?

490
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,310
It's gratuitous.

491
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,810
Really? That's the gratuitous part?

492
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,680
Well, and Dinesh's shaft...

493
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:16,270
- Oh, no.
- Uh...

494
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:20,360
Oh shit.

495
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:22,020
Are one of you the homeowner?

496
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,530
Yeah. I am.

497
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:26,280
We've had a number of complaints
about your artwork here.

498
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:28,830
Look, what you do inside the
house is your own business...

499
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,000
- Oh, no. We don't... We don't do that.
- Oh, no!

500
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:34,090
But that is you, is it not?
The individual on the right?

501
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,870
Yeah.

502
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,210
You're gonna need to paint over this.

503
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:41,389
Oh, I don't think the artist
would like that, he's Latino.

504
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:44,260
- Was that racist?
- Why are you asking me?

505
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:48,350
Oh. I mean, I could've asked
anybody, but your... race...

506
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,300
It doesn't matter. I have a solution.

507
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,770
We put it up.

508
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,440
We don't put it down. Leave it up.

509
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:55,069
No, no, no. No, no, no! Close it!

510
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,890
No...

511
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:02,739
Look at this... left
from the previous tenant.

512
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,980
Unbelievable. I can't believe

513
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:07,200
I didn't enter the garage until this point.

514
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:08,370
I mean, is that marijuanas?

515
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,540
We're gonna need to take those.

516
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:13,240
Or, we leave them and wait to see

517
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:18,160
if the criminal returns
to the scene of the crime.

518
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:20,300
What do you say, please?

519
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:23,150
OK. So I keep the mural,
and I keep the ten G's.

520
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,390
What do you get?

521
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,720
I just thought when I
got a new garage door,

522
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:28,590
maybe you could come and paint a new logo.

523
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,890
Something just as artistic,

524
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,140
but maybe a little less challenging?

525
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:36,310
Hey! Don't look under
there. Get away from there!

526
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,440
That's not me.

527
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:42,490
Um, just to be honest with you, like,

528
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,520
I really, really, really need this.

529
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:48,940
So... I'm trying to be
vulnerable in front of you.

530
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:50,910
I don't know. Is this a safe place?

531
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,670
Look, you can be vulnerable, esé,

532
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,030
but this ain't a safe place.

533
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,420
A plumber got stabbed just last week,

534
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,590
right where you're standing.

535
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,870
What?! Jesus Christ!

536
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,870
What... Why would you stab a plumber?

537
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,639
All right. It was worth a try.

538
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,760
Thanks anyway, Chuy.

539
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:10,050
Wait. Just go ahead and leave the mural.

540
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:12,100
I like looking at it.

541
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:15,100
And plus, I think I know what kind
of logo you white boys might like.

542
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,970
Uh, that's amazing. Thank you, Chuy!

543
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,860
- Uh, yeah. Appreciate it.
- All right, man.

544
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:26,230
- Yes, one of those too.
- All right.

545
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,400
- Another one down.
- Did you really?

546
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:31,499
You still working on that last one?

547
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:38,339
Take your time. There's no rush, Dinesh.

548
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,040
Feeling pretty happy about yourself?

549
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:42,180
I'm pretty happy with ourself.

550
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,550
Hello?

551
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:51,340
Hey, is... Is Richard here?

552
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,390
I don't know.

553
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,930
- Hey.
- Hey.

554
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:58,019
Come to check up on your investment?

555
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,980
Listen, you were right.

556
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,859
I played you a little.

557
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:06,740
Maybe a lot. I got caught
up in making the deal.

558
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:11,360
All right? And I would like to
say I was just doing my job,

559
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:13,869
but that's the excuse that the Nazis used,

560
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:16,080
so I'm not really sure
how effective that one is.

561
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:18,039
Your point being?

562
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,700
I'm sorry.

563
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:22,170
But I'm also not sorry.

564
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,879
The reason I pushed Peter to seed you is,

565
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,840
I think you have an
unbelievably good platform.

566
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:30,719
Way better than the rest of
his other compression plays,

567
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,520
which I apologize for
not telling you about.

568
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:36,350
Look, I know eight weeks
isn't a lot of time

569
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,970
to get this ready,

570
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,720
but I get the feeling you're
the kind of guy that does better

571
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:43,470
when there's a fire lit under his ass.

572
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,739
It's a pretty big fire.

573
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,530
It is.

574
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,610
And by the way,

575
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,530
you're the only one of Peter's companies

576
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:54,150
that I've invested ten percent
of my annual salary in.

577
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:58,790
So I really hope that you can do this.

578
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,910
Uh, well, you know,

579
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:07,670
I guess we'll find out.

580
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,330
I saw the logo out front.

581
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:12,099
I didn't know it was...

582
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:17,010
Cool. Guys, the new logo!

583
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:20,780
- Can we please both go?
- You go first.

584
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:28,690
I love it.

585
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:31,570
Well, it's lowercase,

586
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:34,280
but at least it isn't racist.

587
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:36,530
Is it?

588
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:39,410
It's Chuy Ramirez? I'm impressed.

589
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:42,700
He sold a mural today
for a half-million bucks.

590
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:47,090
It wasn't on a garage door, was it?

591
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,010
You don't think it's too
incendiary for the offices?

592
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:55,260
Kevin, you got where you are
by challenging sensibilities.

593
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:58,139
You know me well.

594
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:02,440
It is pretty raunchy, though.

595
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:13,870
